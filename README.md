2017a-KeepTrip

KeepTrip will allow travelers to keep (to document) their trip in an easy and comfort way, by adding their trip experiences as landmarks (e.g: city, hotel, attraction, resteraunt, etc.) which include: picture, description, location, etc. It will save the information as a timeline, organized by date. It will enable creating multiple trips and share them with friends via facebook\google maps and even export them to pdf.
